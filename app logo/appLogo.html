App Logo 
 
The app logo consists of a letter B, which was positioned as a Bridge (as from BridgeTech), and I 
want to convey the message "bridging the startups and the contractors" in the logo. 

By using a warm color (orange yellow) for the app logo, I want to emphasize a positive and motivated 
working environment because the app BridgeTech aims to help startups to work with contractors more 
effectively and focus on the real roadblocks.
