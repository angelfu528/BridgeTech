# BridgeTech

This repo is based on a team project I participated in my Product Validation and Definition class at CMU. I have learned tremendously about product management in this class and decided to further develop the design of this project personally. 

(* If you are interested in the class itself, here's more information - 
We started with a potential topic Job Sharing. After conducting user interviews with contractors, full-time employees, established companies and startups, we created an affinity diagram with all the potential hot ideas. During this process, we changed/pivoted our product idea from job sharing to workforce management to contractors management.) 

## Background 

BridgeTech is a mobile app that helps startups to manage contractors more effectively by taking care of the entire cycle. Startups can use the app for recruiting, interviewing, payroll (integrations) and contract management, project management, performance evaluation and analytics reports. BridgeTech allows companies to focus on the real issues and building their own products by managing all these tedious processes. At the moment, the target customers are the startups in the US. 

## Components 

##### App Logo 

The app logo consists of a letter B, which was positioned as a Bridge (as from BridgeTech), and I want to convey the message "bridging the startups and the contractors" in the logo. 

By using a warm color (orange yellow) for the app logo, I want to emphasize a positive and motivated working environment because the app BridgeTech aims to help startups to work with contractors more effectively and focus on the real roadblocks.
