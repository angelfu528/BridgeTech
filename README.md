# BridgeTech

## Background 

This repo is based on a team project I participated in my Product Validation and Definition class at CMU. I have learned tremendously about product management in this class and decided to further develop the design of this project personally. 

(* If you are interested in the class itself, here's more information - 
We started with a potential topic Job Sharing. After conducting user interviews with contractors, full-time employees, established companies and startups, we created an affinity diagram with all the potential hot ideas. During this process, we changed/pivoted our product idea from job sharing to workforce management to contractors management.) 

## Product 

### Problem
Startups frequently hire contractors because of their limited resources and temporary needs for different roles. However, companies find it difficult to work with contractors efficiently even with the help of existing contractor management tools. Eventually, startups not only fail to save money by hiring contractors, but they also might have trouble completing the project and delivering to users on time. Here are some of the reasons that might lead to this issue - 

1. Startups didn't have a comprehensive interview process for hiring contractors because they don't want to spend too much resources on it, but that's usually the most critical step - getting the right talents from the beginning. 
2. Startups didn't define the project in clear details, and therefore, what contractors delivered at the end might be different from the company's expectation. 
3. 


### Solution 

BridgeTech is a mobile app that helps startups to manage contractors more effectively by taking care of the entire cycle. Startups can use the app for recruiting, interviewing, payroll (integrations) and contract management, project management, performance evaluation and analytics reports. BridgeTech allows companies to focus on the real issues and building their own products by managing all these tedious processes. At the moment, the target customers are the startups in the US. 

### Designs

##### App Logo 

The app logo consists of a letter B, which was positioned as a Bridge (as from BridgeTech), and I want to convey the message "bridging the startups and the contractors" in the logo. 

By using a warm color (orange yellow) for the app logo, I want to emphasize a positive and motivated working environment because the app BridgeTech aims to help startups to work with contractors more effectively and focus on the real roadblocks. 

##### Landing Page 

The landing page (above the fold) consists of 4 components.  

1. The name of the company and the app logo. 

2. The sections of the landing page - Features, Pricing, About Us and Get The App. 

3. The tagline. 

4. The "Get The App" button. 

With these 4 components, I hope to grab visitors' attention when they first come to the website and encourage to download the app by placing a button at the center of the webpage. Aligning with the color of the app logo, I used orange yellow and white for the landing page as well.
